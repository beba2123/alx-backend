ALX-BACKEND ==> Caching  -->> Caching is a method of storing frequently accessed data in a temporary location called a cache
so that the data can be accessed quickly. A Python cache is a temporary space from which data can be read or written at a very high speed,
as compared to a database or a web service. Caching is used to increase the performance of an application. 
Python cache can be implemented in an application using data structures, decorators, and packages that can integrate external caches into your application.
